The easiest way to get started with Webpack hot-reload, React.js and Meteor is to clone this repository.

## What is this?
The goal of this repository is to help anyone kickstart a new project by using Meteor with React.js and Webpack.

It contains the Meteor Todo example translated to React / Webpack.

- In development, your Webpack bundle is served by a special middleware that is automatically plugged inside Meteor by [`webpack:hot-reload`](https://atmospherejs.com/webpack/hot-reload).

- In production, the code is bundled inside Meteor and allow you to do server-rendering easily with [`reactrouter:react-router-ssr`](https://atmospherejs.com/reactrouter/react-router-ssr).

## Why Webpack?
- You can get hot reload in the browser without having to recompile (it's slow as hell otherwise)
- You don't lose the state of your components every time you change something
- Your components are not all saved in a giant global scope (thank you Meteor but not for this). Instead, you use import or require to get them.
- You can bundle any package for React from NPM without having to bundle it inside a Meteor package

## What goes where?
Only your React components should go in the react folder. Everything else is inside the meteor folder just the way you were doing it before.

- React.js components: in the react folder
- Collections / Methods: in the meteor folder
- Subscriptions: in a server folder inside meteor
- Stylesheets: in a client folder inside meteor
- Assets (image, icons, ...): in the meteor public folder

## Steps
1. `git clone https://github.com/thereactivestack/meteor-webpack-react-kickstart`
2. `./scripts/run-dev.sh`

You will get:
- A configured Webpack build
- React.js configured with react-router
- Hot reload in development
- Server-side rendering in production

## Folders
- `react`: Your React.js application. It must be outside your Meteor project or the server will restart at every file change (it's slow!)
- `meteor`: Your meteor application. Mainly your server stuff and file assets
- `settings`: Your development and production settings for Meteor (you can add your own stuff)
- `webpack`: Your development and production webpack config (go ahead and change the build to work the way you like it)

## Scripts
Every scripts are written both for Linux/Mac (.sh) and for Windows (.bat)

- `run-dev`: Start Meteor with hot-reload
- `run-prod`: Start Meteor with server-rendering (like in production)
- `build`: Build your meteor project including the Webpack bundle
