# kickstart by The Reactive Stack

Kickstart projects are a way to get yourself started fast with a productive setup by cloning the repository.

They all share a very productive stack: Meteor, React.js and Webpack.

- [kickstart-simple](https://github.com/thereactivestack/kickstart-simple): A simple kickstart for small projects or start learning
- [kickstart-hugeapp](https://github.com/thereactivestack/kickstart-hugeapp): A more sophisticated kickstart that include code splitting. If you are planning on having a big application (or a big admin), you should definitively use this one.
- [kickstart-flowrouter](https://github.com/thereactivestack/kickstart-flowrouter): A kickstart for FlowRouter projects.
